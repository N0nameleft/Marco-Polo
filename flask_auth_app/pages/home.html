        <h1> Marco Polo</h1>
        <p>
            Can you hide from one of the greatest explorers in history?
        </p>
        <p>
            Start by thinking of a country to hide in.
            Marco Polo will then ask you a few questions that you will have to answer as truthfully as possible.
            After that, he will guess which country you were hiding in.
